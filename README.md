# Finish Line

Finish line is a tiny bookmarklet for indicating the end of an article within the scroll height of a page. Lots of digital publications load their pages with tons of re-engagement endmatter after the actual article, so it can be difficult to tell how far you are from the true end of the article you're reading.

Finish line detects the endpoint of the actual article text and adds a little indicator near your scrollbar to show you where the finish line is.
